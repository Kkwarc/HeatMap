# Load COCO dataset

Running the coco_load.py will result in the obtaining of a custom COCO dataset consisting of images, which include a person,
a dining table or a chair. The set will contain 1000 images.  <br />
Roboflow was used in the conversion from coco to yolo annotation format.<br /> <br />
Alternatively, you can download the dataset from: <br /> https://app.roboflow.com/ds/Sw3Jxbu9pQ?key=aH9rdAAshH <br />
If you decide to manually download the test, please put it intt 'COCO' folder.
